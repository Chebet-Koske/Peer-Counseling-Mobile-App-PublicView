# Peer-Counseling-Mobile-App
This is a mobile application developed to enable the students of USIU-A have access to peer education and counselling services offered by the school. Morever, give the 
students access to information of what is offered by the peer counselors such as the activities held. Additionally, they can chat with the peer 
counsellors available in the school through the app by showing the list of counsellors available based on gender and redirecting them to WhatsApp.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a public perspective on the project, which is otherwise kept in a private repository. Upon request, you can access the code for viewing. Enjoy!
