# Peer-Counseling-Mobile-App-PublicView
This is a mobile application developed to enable the students of USIU-A have access to peer education and counselling services offered by the school. Additionally, they can chat with the peer counsellors available in the school through the app by showing the list of counsellors available based on gender and redirecting them to WhatsApp.
